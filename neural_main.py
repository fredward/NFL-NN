PLAN:

Do we want to Train or Predict

If Train:
	Pick/Choose the training / testing test -> go train on X interations
	
If Predict:
	1) Choose the NN file (weights) you want to load, and present a way to input team data
		a) scrape from website OR just copy/paste into terminal
	2) Run through the NN
	3) Present output
		a) predicted playoff finish
		b) which teams is this team 'most like'
		c) hopefully some graphics and stuff
		
This can all be done just in a straight forward imperative script
